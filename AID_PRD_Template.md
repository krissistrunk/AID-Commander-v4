## 1. Introduction & Product Vision

### 1.1 Purpose of this Document

This document outlines the product requirements, scope, and implementation plan for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the [Project/Feature Name]. It serves as the primary source of truth for the AI Builder and human stakeholders throughout the development lifecycle.

### 1.2 Product Overview

[Provide a concise overview of the product/feature. What is it? What core problem does it solve? How does it fit into any larger system or ecosystem (e.g., Learnstar)?]

### 1.3 Goals & Objectives for MVP

[List 3-5 clear, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART, if applicable) goals for this MVP release.]

1.  Goal 1: [e.g., Enable users to visually design basic linear course flows.]

2.  Goal 2: [e.g., Provide foundational AI (ARCHITECT) assistance for pedagogical suggestions.]

3.  Goal 3: [e.g., Ensure reliable local PWA data persistence for offline work.]

### 1.4 Critical MVP Success Metrics

[Define the single most critical metric (or very few key metrics) that will determine the success of this MVP launch. This should align with the overarching goals.]

*   Primary Metric: [e.g., X% of new course creators successfully publish a 3-room course within Y minutes.]

*   Secondary Metric: [e.g., AI suggestions accepted by creators at a rate of Z%.]

### 1.5 Target Users

[Describe the primary target user(s) for this MVP. Include personas if available/helpful.]

*   Primary User Persona 1: [e.g., Novice Instructional Designer]

*   Needs: [e.g., Guided experience, clear instructions, simple tools]

*   Motivations: [e.g., Quickly create effective basic courses]

*   Primary User Persona 2: [e.g., Experienced Course Creator]

*   Needs: [e.g., Efficient tools, flexibility, ability to implement specific pedagogical approaches]

*   Motivations: [e.g., Enhance existing courses with learning science, save time]

### 1.6 Definition of Done (for this MVP/Project)

[Clearly state the criteria that must be met for this MVP to be considered "Done" and ready for its intended release/purpose.]

1.  All functional requirements listed in Section 5 are implemented and pass their acceptance criteria.

2.  All critical and high-priority tasks in the Master Task List (`[Path_To_Master_Task_List.md]`) are marked `[x]`.

3.  Key performance and non-functional requirements (Section 6) are met.

4.  All required documentation (e.g., basic user guides for new features - can be AI-generated tasks) is complete.

5.  Successful deployment to the target MVP environment (e.g., staging for UAT, internal release).

## 2. Core User Workflows & Experience (MVP)

[Detail the primary user journeys and workflows. Use user stories where appropriate.]

### 2.1 Workflow: [Name of Workflow 1, e.g., Creator: Initial Course Setup & Basic Design]

*   **User Story/Goal:** As a [User Persona], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

*   **Steps:**

1.  [Step 1 description]

*   Acceptance Criteria: [...]

2.  [Step 2 description]

*   Acceptance Criteria: [...]

*   **UI Mockup/Wireframe Reference (Optional):** [Link to or embed relevant visuals]

### 2.2 Workflow: [Name of Workflow 2]

*   ...

## 3. System Architecture & Technical Foundation

[Describe the high-level technical architecture relevant to this project/feature.]

### 3.1 Deployment Model

[e.g., Micro-frontend + PWA. Rationale for choice.]

### 3.2 Core Technology Stack (AI-Enhanced Framework Suggestions)

**ðŸ¤– AI Framework Advisory Enabled**

When completing this section, your AI Builder will provide intelligent framework recommendations based on:
- Project requirements and complexity
- Target user technical expertise  
- Performance and scalability needs
- Integration requirements with existing systems
- Team capabilities and timeline constraints

**AI Suggestion Protocol:**
For each technology layer, the AI will provide:

1. **ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Framework** (â‰¥95% confidence)
2. **ðŸ§  Detailed Reasoning:**
   - **Technical Considerations:** Performance, scalability, learning curve
   - **Best Practices:** Industry standards, proven approaches
   - **Project Context:** Team skills, timeline, feature complexity
   - **Risk Mitigation:** Maintenance, community support, future-proofing
3. **ðŸ”„ Alternative Options** with trade-off analysis
4. **ðŸ“‹ Implementation Impact** on subsequent tasks and development complexity

**Technology Stack Areas for AI Analysis:**
- **Frontend Framework:** [AI will suggest React, Vue, Angular, etc. based on requirements]
- **Backend Technology:** [AI will recommend Node.js, Python, .NET, etc.]  
- **Database Choice:** [AI will propose SQL vs NoSQL options]
- **State Management:** [AI will suggest Redux, Context, Zustand, etc.]
- **Testing Framework:** [AI will recommend Jest, Cypress, Playwright, etc.]
- **Build & Deploy Tools:** [AI will propose Vite, Webpack, Docker, etc.]

**Example AI Framework Suggestion Format:**
```
ðŸ¤– AI Recommendation: React + TypeScript
ðŸ“Š Confidence Level: 98%
ðŸ§  Reasoning:
- Technical: Strong type safety reduces bugs, excellent performance
- Best Practice: Industry standard for complex UIs, extensive ecosystem
- Project Context: Team familiar with React, timeline allows for TypeScript setup
- Risk Mitigation: Large community, long-term support, easy to hire developers
ðŸ”„ Alternatives: Vue 3 (simpler learning curve), Angular (enterprise features)
ðŸ“‹ Impact: Adds ~2 hours TypeScript configuration, reduces debugging time by ~20%
```
