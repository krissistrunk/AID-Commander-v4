App creation process v2



Okay, understood! We will first produce the `AID_PRD_Template.md` artifact. Then, I will compile *everything* we've discussed about the AID Workflow (including the template itself and all prompt skeletons) into one final, comprehensive documentation. This will be the master guide for anyone wanting to use this methodology.



Let's start with the PRD template.

This `AID_PRD_Template.md` provides a comprehensive structure. The crucial part will be populating Section 5 with detailed, AI-ready tasks, which we'll do using our iterative refinement process.



Now, I will compile the **Final Complete Documentation of the entire AID Process**, including instructions for users, the templates we've designed (like this PRD template and the prompt skeletons), and everything else needed to replicate the workflow.



Excellent. Breaking it into parts will make it more digestible and easier to review for completeness. I'll structure the final AID Workflow documentation into logical sections.



Here is **Part 1: Introduction, Philosophy, and Core Artifacts** of the comprehensive AID Workflow documentation.

**The AI-Facilitated Iterative Development (AID) Workflow: A Comprehensive Guide**



**Part 1: Introduction, Philosophy, and Core Artifacts**



**1. Introduction: What is the AID Workflow?**



The AI-Facilitated Iterative Development (AID) Workflow is a systematic methodology for designing and developing complex software applications. It uniquely positions an advanced AI Builder as the primary implementer of code and configurations, while human experts (Product Owners and Design Facilitators) provide strategic direction, detailed requirements, and rigorous verification.



This workflow is designed to:



*   **Leverage AI Strengths:** Utilize AI for rapid code generation, pattern implementation, and handling repetitive development tasks.

*   **Maintain Human Oversight:** Ensure that product vision, user experience, pedagogical integrity (for learning systems like Learnstar), and quality are driven by human expertise.

*   **Maximize Efficiency:** Streamline the development process through clear communication protocols with the AI Builder.

*   **Ensure Quality & Precision:** Implement a "Confidence Threshold & Clarification Loop" to minimize AI misinterpretations and ensure requirements are fully understood before implementation.

*   **Create Robust, AI-Ready Documentation:** Produce Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and task lists that are specifically structured for an AI Builder to consume.



The AID Workflow transforms the traditional software development lifecycle into a collaborative partnership between human ingenuity and artificial intelligence.



**2. Core Philosophy & Principles**



The AID Workflow is built on the following foundational principles:



*   **Human-Guiding, AI-Implementing:** Humans are the architects of the "what" and "why." The AI Builder is the constructor, handling the "how" of technical implementation.

*   **Granularity for Clarity & Control:** Complex problems are decomposed into the smallest logical, independently testable units (sub-tasks). This enhances the AI's comprehension, simplifies verification, and makes the process manageable.

*   **Iterative Refinement with Verification:** Development proceeds in small, verifiable steps. Each AI-implemented sub-task is reviewed and approved by humans before the AI moves to the next, creating a tight feedback loop.

*   **Enhanced 95% Confidence & AI Suggest Protocol:** The AI Builder must achieve a high level of confidence (e.g., 95%) in its understanding of a task *before* starting implementation. When unsure, it follows the enhanced clarification protocol: asks question, provides suggested solution with rationale, requests human approval or alternative.

*   **Living, Version-Controlled Documentation:** The PRD and Master Task List are dynamic, shared artifacts, version-controlled (e.g., via Git/GitHub), serving as the single source of truth for both humans and the AI Builder.

*   **AI-Ready Specifications:** All requirements are articulated with a level of precision, unambiguity, and functional detail that an AI Builder can directly interpret and act upon.

*   **Focus on Functional Outcomes:** Specifications describe *what* needs to be achieved and *how* success is measured, rather than prescribing specific code implementation details (unless a unique algorithm or critical technical constraint exists).



**3. Core Artifacts of the AID Workflow**



Successful implementation of the AID Workflow relies on several key documents and templates, managed within a version control system (e.g., a GitHub repository for each project).



*   **3.1. `AI_Builder_Core_System_Prompt.txt` (or equivalent AI Builder setup):**

*   **Purpose:** This is a persistent, universal prompt that sets the global context, operational rules, and core interaction protocols for the AI Builder for an entire project (e.g., the entire "Learnstar Course Builder MVP" project, or in our example, the "Tetris MVP" project).

*   **Key Content:**

*   AI Builder's role and overarching project mission.

*   **Crucially, paths to other key dynamic documents:**

*   `[Path_To_Current_Project_PRD_Markdown_File.md]`

*   `[Path_To_Master_Task_List_Markdown_File.md]`

*   *(Optional)* `[Path_To_Project_AI_Implementation_Guide.md]` (for MCP server details, advanced AI configurations).

*   *(Optional)* `[Path_To_Global_Design_System_Docs.md]`

*   *(Optional)* `[Path_To_Global_Data_Models.md]`

*   Core Development Principles (Modularity, Adherence to PRD).

*   The "No Redundant Work" rule, referencing the Master Task List for 'Done' tasks.

*   The "Enhanced 95% Confidence & AI Suggest Protocol."

*   Instructions on how it will receive tasks (typically via Task ID referencing the PRD).

*   **Usage:** Loaded or set once at the beginning of a major development project or phase. The path to the "Current Project PRD" is updated when work shifts to a new PRD.

*   **Example Snippet (Conceptual - actual content in a separate file):**

```

"You are an expert AI Software Builder for the [Project Name] project.

Refer to these primary documents for all context and tasks:

- Current PRD: [Path_To_Current_Project_PRD_Markdown_File.md]

- Master Task List: [Path_To_Master_Task_List_Markdown_File.md]

Your core directive: Follow the Enhanced 95% Confidence & AI Suggest Protocol for every assigned task. Do not modify 'Done' tasks..."

**AI Suggest Mode Enhancement:** When your confidence is below 95%, follow the enhanced clarification protocol:
1. State your clarification question
2. Immediately provide your best suggestion with reasoning
3. Ask for human approval or alternative
4. Only proceed when you have explicit human confirmation

This accelerates the clarification process while maintaining quality control.

```



*   **3.2. `[ProjectName]_PRD_Template.md`:**

*   **Purpose:** A standardized Markdown template for creating detailed, AI-Ready Product Requirements Documents.

*   **Key Sections (as detailed in our previous "Artifact Generation" step):**

1.  Document Control & Version History

2.  Introduction & Product Vision (Purpose, Overview, Goals, Success Metrics, Target Users, Definition of Done)

3.  Core User Workflows & Experience

4.  System Architecture & Technical Foundation

5.  Detailed Data Models

6.  Functional Requirements & Implementation Tasks (This is where detailed tasks for AI are nested)

7.  Non-Functional Requirements

8.  Integration & Testing Strategy

9.  Future Considerations / Post-MVP Roadmap

10. Glossary of Terms

11. Change Log (for the PRD document itself)

*   **Usage:** The Design Facilitator and Product Owner use this template to collaboratively build the PRD for each project or major component.



*   **3.3. `[ProjectName]_Master_Task_List.md`:**

*   **Purpose:** The central, dynamic document for tracking all development tasks and their statuses. This file is read and *updated* by the AI Builder (upon human approval).

*   **Structure:** Hierarchical Markdown list.

*   Parent Tasks (derived from PRD Section 5 Task Areas).

*   Sub-tasks (detailed, actionable implementation units).

*   **Information per Task/Sub-task:**

*   `[StatusMarker]` (e.g., `[ ]`, `[>]`, `[!]`, `[R]`, `[x]`)

*   `Task ID` (e.g., CB-5.1.1)

*   `Task Title`

*   `PRD Section Reference`

*   `Priority` (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low - set by humans)

*   `AI_Complexity_Rating` (e.g., Low, Medium, High - estimated by humans or AI)

*   `Dependencies` (Task IDs that must be 'Done' first)

*   `AI Confidence Log` (A brief note if extensive Q&A was needed for this task)

*   `Relevant Files` (List of files to be created/modified for this task, including test files - often populated by AI during sub-task generation)

*   **Status Markers:**

*   `[ ]`: To Do / Ready for AI Clarification

*   `[!]`: Pending AI Clarification (AI confidence < 95%)

*   `[>]`: Ready for AI Build / AI In Progress (AI confidence >= 95%)

*   `[R]`: Revision Requested (Review failed)

*   `[x]`: Done (Implemented and Human Approved)

*   **Usage:** The Facilitator initially populates high-level tasks and priorities. AI helps generate sub-tasks. AI updates status to `[x]` upon approval. Facilitator manages other statuses.



*   **3.4. Prompt Snippet/Template: `Generate_Subtasks_From_PRD_Section_Prompt.txt` (Conceptual):**

*   Used by the Facilitator to instruct the AI Builder to break down a PRD section into sub-tasks and populate the "Relevant Files" section. (Content detailed in previous example).



*   **3.5. Prompt Snippet/Template: `Implement_Specific_Subtask_Prompt.txt` (Conceptual):**

*   Used by the Facilitator to assign a fully clarified sub-task to the AI Builder for implementation. (Content detailed in previous example).



*   **3.6. Prompt Snippet/Template: `Approve_Task_And_Update_Master_List_Prompt.txt` (Conceptual):**

*   Used by the Facilitator to instruct the AI Builder to mark a task as complete in the `Master_Task_List.md` after review. (Content detailed in previous example).



*   **3.7. `[ProjectName]_Future_Considerations.md` (Idea Bucket):**

*   A simple document to log off-topic ideas or post-MVP features that arise during any phase. Reviewed periodically.

This concludes Part 1, covering the introduction, philosophy, and core artifacts of the AID Workflow. This sets the stage for understanding the roles and the step-by-step processes.



———————————————————————————————————————————————————



Okay, here is **Part 2: Human Roles & Responsibilities in the AID Workflow** of the comprehensive AID Workflow documentation.



---



**The AI-Facilitated Iterative Development (AID) Workflow: A Comprehensive Guide**



**Part 2: Human Roles & Responsibilities**



While the AI Builder handles the primary implementation tasks, the success of the AID Workflow hinges on clearly defined human roles that provide strategic direction, detailed requirements, oversight, and quality assurance. For smaller projects or teams, one individual might wear multiple hats, but the distinct responsibilities remain.



**2.1. The Product Owner (User / Vision Holder)**



*   **Primary Responsibility:** Defines the product vision, business goals, user needs, and overall strategic direction. They are the ultimate authority on *what* needs to be built and *why*.

*   **Key Activities:**

*   **Vision Articulation:** Provides the initial product idea, target audience insights, and desired market positioning.

*   **Requirement Prioritization:** Decides which features are critical for MVP and subsequent releases. Sets task priorities in consultation with the Design Facilitator.

*   **Answering "Why" & "What":** During the "Enhanced 95% Confidence & AI Suggest Loop," the Product Owner is the primary source for answering the AI Builder's questions and approving/modifying AI suggestions about user needs, feature intent, business rules, and acceptance criteria.

*   **User Story Definition:** Crafts or approves user stories that capture the essence of feature functionality from the user's perspective.

*   **Acceptance Criteria Validation:** Reviews implemented features against defined acceptance criteria.

*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Lead:** Leads or significantly participates in UAT to ensure the product meets user needs and business objectives.

*   **Final Approval & Sign-off:** Provides the final approval for PRD sections, completed tasks, and the overall product release ("Definition of Done").

*   **Scope Management:** Makes decisions on feature scope, especially when trade-offs are necessary. Manages the "Future Considerations" list.

*   **Interaction with AI Builder:** Primarily indirect, through the Design Facilitator. The Product Owner's insights are translated by the Facilitator into AI-ready specifications.



**2.2. The Design Facilitator (AI Orchestrator / Process Guardian)**



*   **Primary Responsibility:** Manages the entire AID Workflow, ensuring smooth collaboration between the Product Owner and the AI Builder. They translate product vision into AI-ready specifications and act as the primary human interface for the AI Builder.

*   **Key Activities:**

*   **Workflow Management:** Owns and executes the 6-Step Design & PRD Creation Process and the AI-Driven Implementation Workflow.

*   **PRD Authorship & Maintenance:** Collaboratively drafts the `[ProjectName]_PRD_Template.md` with the Product Owner, ensuring all sections are detailed and AI-ready. Manages PRD versions and the PRD Change Log.

*   **Task Management:**

*   Maintains the `[ProjectName]_Master_Task_List.md`, updating statuses (except for AI marking tasks `[x]`), priorities, dependencies, and complexity ratings.

*   Uses the `Generate_Subtasks_From_PRD_Section_Prompt` to have the AI Builder draft sub-task lists. Reviews and refines these AI-generated lists with the Product Owner.

*   **AI Prompt Engineering & Interaction:**

*   Sets up the `AI_Builder_Core_System_Prompt.txt` for the AI Builder.

*   Uses the `Implement_Specific_Subtask_Prompt` to assign clarified tasks to the AI Builder.

*   Manages the "Enhanced 95% Confidence & AI Suggest Loop": reviews AI Builder's questions and suggestions, coordinates with Product Owner for approval/modification of AI suggestions, refines task specifications, and ensures the AI Builder reaches 95%+ confidence before implementation.

*   **Quality Assurance & Review:**

*   Conducts initial reviews of the AI Builder's output (code, configurations, documentation).

*   Coordinates with QA teams or performs testing for more complex integrations.

*   Provides specific feedback to the AI Builder for revisions.

*   Uses the `Approve_Task_And_Update_Master_List_Prompt` to instruct the AI to mark approved tasks as 'Done'.

*   **Documentation & Artifact Management:** Ensures all key artifacts are up-to-date and stored in the version control system.

*   **Scope & Off-Topic Idea Management:** Manages the "Future Considerations" list.

*   **Process Improvement:** Continuously refines prompts and processes for better AI Builder collaboration.

*   **Interaction with AI Builder:** Direct and continuous. The Design Facilitator is the AI Builder's main point of contact.



**2.3. Quality Assurance (QA) Team / Testers (Human or AI-Assisted)**



*   **Primary Responsibility:** Verifying that implemented features meet requirements, are free of critical defects, and align with user experience goals.

*   **Key Activities:**

*   **Test Case Development:** Creates test cases based on PRD requirements and acceptance criteria (this itself can be a task for the AI Builder, reviewed by humans).

*   **Manual & Automated Testing:** Executes tests on AI-generated code and features.

*   **Bug Reporting:** Documents and reports defects found during testing.

*   **Regression Testing:** Ensures new changes don't break existing functionality.

*   **UAT Support:** May support the Product Owner during User Acceptance Testing.

*   **Interaction with AI Builder:** Indirect. QA feedback is typically relayed through the Design Facilitator, who then translates it into revision tasks for the AI Builder.



**2.4. Stakeholders (e.g., Lead Developer/Architect, Business Units, Marketing)**



*   **Primary Responsibility:** Provide input, review, and approval at key stages, particularly for the PRD and major feature milestones.

*   **Key Activities:**

*   Participate in PRD review cycles.

*   Provide specialized feedback (e.g., technical feasibility from Lead Architect, market fit from Marketing).

*   Participate in UAT where appropriate.

*   **Interaction with AI Builder:** None directly. Communication flows through the Product Owner and Design Facilitator.



**Key Collaboration Dynamics:**



*   The **Product Owner** and **Design Facilitator** work in very close collaboration, especially during PRD creation and when clarifying AI Builder questions.

*   The **Design Facilitator** acts as the bridge, translating business and user needs from the Product Owner into precise, technical instructions for the **AI Builder**.

*   The **AI Builder** executes tasks based on these instructions, seeking clarification when needed, and relies on the Facilitator for review and approval to update the **Master Task List**.



This clear delineation of roles and responsibilities ensures that all aspects of product development, from strategic vision to detailed implementation and quality assurance, are covered effectively within the AID Workflow.

This concludes Part 2, detailing the Human Roles & Responsibilities.



Ready for **Part 3: The Detailed Step-by-Step AID Workflow (including the Tetris Example integrated as an illustration at each step)**? This will be the longest part, bringing everything together.  —————————————————————————————————————————————



Okay, perfect! We'll definitely use multiple parts for **Part 3: The Detailed Step-by-Step AID Workflow** to ensure every nuance is captured clearly. This section is the operational heart of the entire methodology.



Let's begin with the initial phases of the workflow.



---



**The AI-Facilitated Iterative Development (AID) Workflow: A Comprehensive Guide**



**Part 3.1: Workflow Step 1 & 2 - Project Initiation and PRD Creation**



This part details the initial setup and the collaborative process of creating the AI-Ready Product Requirements Document (PRD).



**Step 1: Project Initiation & Setup**



*   **1.1. Define Project Scope & Objectives (Product Owner & Design Facilitator):**

*   **Action:** The Product Owner articulates the high-level vision for the new product or feature, its primary goals, target audience, and any known major constraints or success metrics.

*   **Facilitator's Role:** Asks probing questions to clarify the vision, helps define measurable objectives, and identifies the core problem being solved.

*   **Output:** A clear, concise project charter or initial vision statement.

*   **Tetris Example:**

*   *Product Owner:* "I want to build a classic Tetris game for casual web play."

*   *Facilitator:* "Great! What's the main goal – a quick fun diversion, or will it have competitive elements? Who's the primary player?"

*   *User:* "Just fun. Anyone who knows Tetris."



*   **1.2. Establish Core Artifacts & Repository (Design Facilitator):**

*   **Action:** Create a new version-controlled repository (e.g., on GitHub) for the project (e.g., `AID_Tetris_Example`).

*   Within the repository, create initial blank or template versions of:

*   `[ProjectName]_PRD_Template.md` (copied from the universal template we generated). This will become the `Tetris_MVP_PRD_v0.1.md`.

*   `[ProjectName]_Master_Task_List.md` (e.g., `Tetris_Tasks_v0.1.md`). Initially, this might just have a placeholder or high-level task areas.

*   *(Optional)* `[ProjectName]_Future_Considerations.md`.

*   **Facilitator's Role:** Sets up the repository structure and ensures the correct PRD template is used.

*   **Tetris Example:** Facilitator creates the `AID_Tetris_Example` repo with `Tetris_MVP_PRD_v0.1.md` (based on our template) and an empty `Tetris_Tasks_v0.1.md`.



*   **1.3. Configure AI Builder's Core System Prompt (Design Facilitator):**

*   **Action:** The Facilitator configures the AI Builder instance that will work on this project with the `AI_Builder_Core_System_Prompt.txt`. This involves:

*   Loading the universal system prompt text.

*   **Crucially, updating the file path placeholders within that prompt** to point to the specific `Tetris_MVP_PRD_vX.X.md` and `Tetris_Tasks_vX.X.md` files for this project.

*   **Facilitator's Role:** Ensures the AI Builder has the correct overarching context and knows which documents are its primary sources of truth for this specific project.

*   **Tetris Example:** Facilitator ensures the AI Builder's system prompt now includes:

```

...

- Current PRD: AID_Tetris_Example/Tetris_MVP_PRD_v1.0.md

- Master Task List: AID_Tetris_Example/Tetris_Tasks_v1.0.md

...

```



**Step 2: Collaborative PRD Creation (Following the 6-Step Design Process within the PRD Template)**



This is an iterative process where the Design Facilitator guides the Product Owner section by section through the `[ProjectName]_PRD_Template.md`.



*   **2.1. Populate PRD Section 1: Introduction & Product Vision (Product Owner & Facilitator):**

*   **Action:** Collaboratively fill out: Purpose of Document, Product Overview, Goals & Objectives for MVP, Critical MVP Success Metrics, Target Users, Definition of Done for MVP.

*   **Facilitator's Role:** Asks clarifying questions for each sub-section to ensure detail and clarity suitable for the AI Builder. (e.g., "For success metrics, how will we *quantify* casual fun? Perhaps session length or games per session?")

*   **Tetris Example:**

*   The PRD section 1 is filled, defining the goal as "a simple, engaging Tetris experience," success as "players completing an average of 3 games per session," and target users as "casual web players familiar with Tetris." Definition of Done includes all core mechanics functioning.



*   **2.2. Populate PRD Section 2: Core User Workflows & Experience (Product Owner & Facilitator):**

*   **Action:** Detail the primary user journeys. The Facilitator helps translate these into user stories if needed.

*   **Facilitator's Role:** Probes for edge cases or alternative flows. "What happens if a player tries to rotate a piece when it's blocked?"

*   **Tetris Example:** The 5 core workflows (start game, control pieces, clear lines, game over, see score/next piece) are detailed with simple user stories like "As a player, I want to move falling pieces left and right so I can position them correctly."



*   **2.3. Populate PRD Section 3: System Architecture & Technical Foundation (Facilitator, with input from PO/Technical Stakeholders if available):**

*   **Action:** Define high-level architecture (e.g., "Client-Side Web Application"), core technologies (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS), and key patterns (e.g., "Game Loop," "State Management for game board").

*   **Facilitator's Role:** Suggests standard or appropriate architectures if PO is non-technical. "For a browser game like Tetris, a client-side JavaScript implementation with HTML5 Canvas for rendering is typical. Does that align with your expectations?"

*   **Tetris Example:** Architecture is defined as a single-page web application using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. No complex backend needed for MVP.



*   **2.4. Populate PRD Section 4: Detailed Data Models (Facilitator, with input from PO):**

*   **Action:** Define key data structures.

*   **Facilitator's Role:** Helps identify necessary data entities. "How will we represent the game board? A 2D array? How will we define the Tetromino shapes and their rotation states?"

*   **Tetris Example:** Data models for the `GameBoard` (e.g., 10x20 array), `Tetromino` (shape definitions, rotation matrices, current position), and `GameState` (score, next piece, game over status) are outlined.



*   **2.5. Populate PRD Section 7: Integration & Testing Strategy (Facilitator & PO):**

*   (Section 5 - Functional Requirements & Tasks - will be largely generated by AI in the next phase).

*   **Action:** Outline how this component integrates (if at all for Tetris MVP, it's standalone). Define testing approach (e.g., "Manual gameplay testing for core mechanics, unit tests for game logic functions").

*   **Facilitator's Role:** Guides discussion on testability and key areas to validate.

*   **Tetris Example:** Testing focuses on validating each functional requirement (movement, rotation, line clearing, scoring, game over). Unit tests for `board.js` and `tetromino.js` logic are specified.



*   **2.6. Populate Other PRD Sections (Future Considerations, Glossary, etc.) (Facilitator & PO):**

*   **Action:** Fill in remaining sections like Non-Functional Requirements (Section 6), Out of Scope (Section 1.X of Intro or dedicated section), Future Considerations, and Glossary.

*   **Tetris Example:** Non-Functional: "Smooth animation." Future Considerations: "Levels, hold piece."



*   **2.7. PRD Review & Approval (Internal - Facilitator & PO First):**

*   **Action:** The Facilitator and Product Owner review the entire drafted PRD for completeness, clarity, consistency, and AI-readiness.

*   **Facilitator's Role:** "Does this PRD accurately capture everything we need to tell the AI Builder to construct the Tetris MVP?"

*   **Output:** `Tetris_MVP_PRD_v0.9.md` (Draft for Approval).



*   **2.8. (Optional but Recommended) Stakeholder Review & Formal PRD Approval:**

*   **Action:** The `Tetris_MVP_PRD_v0.9.md` is shared with any other key stakeholders for feedback. Revisions made.

*   **Output:** `Tetris_MVP_PRD_v1.0.md` (Approved version).

This concludes Part 3.1, covering Project Initiation and the detailed PRD Creation process. We now have an approved `Tetris_MVP_PRD_v1.0.md`.



Ready for **Part 3.2: Workflow Step 3 & 4 - AI-Assisted Task Generation and Iterative Sub-Task Implementation (using the Tetris example)**?  ———————————————————————————————————————————————————



Okay, let's dive into **Part 3.2: Workflow Step 3 & 4 - AI-Assisted Task Generation and Iterative Sub-Task Implementation**, continuing with our Tetris game example.



---



**The AI-Facilitated Iterative Development (AID) Workflow: A Comprehensive Guide**



**Part 3.2: Workflow Step 3 & 4 - AI Task Generation & Iterative Implementation**



With the approved `Tetris_MVP_PRD_v1.0.md` in place and the AI Builder's Core System Prompt configured to reference it and the `Tetris_Tasks_v1.0.md` file, we now proceed to implementation.



**Step 3: AI-Assisted Sub-Task Generation**



*   **3.1. Prompt AI Builder for Parent Task Generation (Design Facilitator):**

*   **Action:** The Facilitator instructs the AI Builder to analyze the PRD and propose high-level parent tasks.

*   **Facilitator Prompt (Conceptual, using principles from `Generate_Subtasks_From_PRD_Section_Prompt.txt` but for parent tasks first):**

```

"AI Builder, please analyze the entire 'Tetris_MVP_PRD_v1.0.md'.

Based on this PRD, generate a list of the main, high-level parent tasks required to implement the Tetris MVP.

For each parent task, also preliminarily identify potential new source code files (and their corresponding test files) that might be needed for the overall project.

Present these parent tasks and preliminary file list in Markdown format, ready to be inserted into 'Tetris_Tasks_v1.0.md'.

After generating these parent tasks, await my confirmation ('Go') before attempting to generate any sub-tasks."

```

*   **Simulated AI Builder Response (Saved by Facilitator into `Tetris_Tasks_v1.0.md`):**

```markdown

## Parent Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Setup Basic HTML Structure and Canvas Rendering

- [ ] 2.0 Implement Game Board Representation and Logic

- [ ] 3.0 Implement Tetromino Definition, Generation, and Movement

- [ ] 4.0 Implement Tetromino Rotation Logic

- [ ] 5.0 Implement Line Clearing Mechanism and Scoring System

- [ ] 6.0 Implement Game Loop and Game Over Conditions

- [ ] 7.0 Develop UI Elements (Score Display, Next Piece Display)

- [ ] 8.0 Integrate Keyboard Controls



I have generated the high-level parent tasks and a preliminary list of relevant files based on the PRD.

Ready to generate the sub-tasks for each parent task? Respond with 'Go [Parent Task ID]' (e.g., 'Go 1.0') to proceed one parent task at a time, or 'Go All' to generate for all.

```

*   **Facilitator's Role:** Reviews the parent tasks for completeness and logical flow. Verifies the preliminary file list seems reasonable.



*   **3.2. Prompt AI Builder for Sub-Task Generation (Iterative for each Parent Task - Design Facilitator):**

*   **Action:** The Facilitator instructs the AI Builder to generate sub-tasks for one parent task at a time.

*   **Facilitator Prompt:** "Go 1.0"

*   **Simulated AI Builder Action:** The AI now focuses on "Parent Task 1.0: Setup Basic HTML Structure and Canvas Rendering" and proposes sub-tasks for it. The AI updates `Tetris_Tasks_v1.0.md` under Parent Task 1.0.

```markdown

# Master Task List: Tetris MVP

...

## Parent Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Setup Basic HTML Structure and Canvas Rendering

- [ ] 1.1 Create `index.html` with a title, a single HTML5 `<canvas id="tetris-board">` element, and a link to `style.css` and `src/game.js`.

- [ ] 1.2 Create `style.css` to center the canvas on the page and apply a visible border.

- [ ] 1.3 In `src/renderer.js`, create a function to get the canvas context and clear it to a background color.

- [ ] 1.4 In `src/game.js`, write initial code to call the clear canvas function from `renderer.js` to test basic setup.

- [ ] 2.0 Implement Game Board Representation and Logic

...

```

The AI might then say: "Sub-tasks for 1.0 generated. Ready for next parent task? Respond with 'Go [Parent Task ID]'."

*   **Facilitator's Role:** Reviews these sub-tasks for clarity, completeness, and logical sequence. Ensures they align with the PRD's functional requirements for that parent task. Makes any necessary manual refinements to the sub-task descriptions in the `Tetris_Tasks_v1.0.md` file. This review process *is* our human Q&A loop for the *task generation* step.

*   *(This process is repeated for all Parent Tasks: "Go 2.0", "Go 3.0", etc., until all sub-tasks are generated and reviewed in `Tetris_Tasks_v1.0.md`)*.

*   **At the end of Step 3, `Tetris_Tasks_v1.0.md` is fully populated with parent tasks and their reviewed sub-tasks, all with status `[ ]`.**



**Step 4: Iterative Sub-Task Implementation & Verification**



This is the core AI development loop, managed by the Design Facilitator.



*   **4.1. Assign First Sub-Task to AI Builder (Design Facilitator):**

*   **Action:** The Facilitator identifies the first sub-task (e.g., 1.1 from `Tetris_Tasks_v1.0.md`) and assigns it to the AI Builder.

*   **Facilitator Prompt (Using `Implement_Specific_Subtask_Prompt.txt` principles):**

```

"**Current Task for AI Builder:**



*   **Task ID:** 1.1

*   **Task Title:** Create `index.html`

*   **Full Specification (from PRD and refined in Master Task List):**

---

Create the file `index.html`. It must include:

1.  A DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5.

2.  An `<html>` tag with `lang="en"`.

3.  A `<head>` section containing:

*   UTF-8 charset meta tag.

*   Viewport meta tag for responsive design (`width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0`).

*   A `<title>` element: "Classic Tetris Game".

*   A `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`.

4.  A `<body>` section containing:

*   A single `<canvas>` element with `id="tetris-board"` and default dimensions (e.g., width="200" height="400").

*   A `<script src="src/game.js" defer></script>` tag.

---

*   **Relevant Files:** `index.html` (to be created).

*   **Dependencies Met:** None.



Implement this Current Task (1.1) precisely as specified. Upon completion of your build, await review.



Remember your 95% Confidence & Clarification Protocol. Ask questions if you are not 95% confident BEFORE starting implementation."

```

*   Facilitator updates Master Task List for Task 1.1 to `[>]` (Ready for AI Build / AI In Progress).



*   **4.2. AI Builder Enhanced Confidence Check & AI Suggest Protocol:**

*   **Simulated AI Builder:** "Confidence: 99%. I understand the requirements for Task 1.1. No further questions." 

*   **Or, if unsure (demonstrating AI Suggest Mode):** "I need clarification on the canvas dimensions in 1.1. 

My suggestion: Default dimensions of 300x600 pixels - this provides a 1:2 aspect ratio that's typical for Tetris games and fits well on most screens without requiring scrolling. 

Does this work for you, or would you prefer different dimensions?"

*   **Enhanced Protocol Flow:**
   1. AI asks clarification question
   2. AI immediately provides suggested solution with rationale
   3. Human approves suggestion or provides alternative
   4. AI confirms understanding and proceeds when ≥95% confident



*   **4.3. AI Builder Implements Sub-Task:**

*   **Action:** AI Builder generates the `index.html` file.

*   **Simulated AI Builder:** "Task 1.1 implementation (creation of `index.html`) is complete. Please review."



*   **4.4. Human Review & Verification (Design Facilitator &/or QA):**

*   **Action:** Facilitator opens and inspects the AI-generated `index.html`. Verifies all acceptance criteria are met.

*   **Facilitator:** "The `index.html` looks correct and meets all specified requirements for Task 1.1."



*   **4.5. Approve Task & Instruct AI to Update Master List (Design Facilitator):**

*   **Action:** Facilitator gives approval and instructs AI to update the shared task list.

*   **Facilitator Prompt (Using `Approve_Task_And_Update_Master_List_Prompt.txt` principles):**

```

"Task 1.1 - 'Create index.html' has been reviewed and is APPROVED.



Please update the 'AID_Tetris_Example/Tetris_Tasks_v1.0.md' file:

1.  Change the status of sub-task 1.1 from '[>]' to '[x]' (Done).

2.  Since this is the first sub-task, the parent task 1.0 is not yet complete.



Confirm when the Master Task List has been updated."

```

*   **Simulated AI Builder Action:** AI Builder modifies `Tetris_Tasks_v1.0.md`:

```markdown

- [ ] 1.0 Setup Basic HTML Structure and Canvas Rendering

- [x] 1.1 Create `index.html` ...

```

*   **Simulated AI Builder:** "Master Task List `Tetris_Tasks_v1.0.md` updated for Task 1.1. Sub-task 1.1 marked as [x]."



*   **4.6. Repeat for Next Sub-Task:**

*   The Facilitator proceeds to assign Task 1.2 ("Create `style.css`..."), and the loop (4.1 to 4.5) continues for every sub-task.

*   Once all sub-tasks under a parent (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 under 1.0) are `[x]`, the AI (when instructed for the last sub-task's approval) will also mark the parent task `[x]`.

This detailed walkthrough with the Tetris example should make the AID workflow, including the AI's role in task generation and task list maintenance, very clear.



This concludes Part 3.2.



Ready for **Part 3.3: Workflow Step 5 & 6 - Quality Assurance, Final PRD, and Delivery Planning (with Tetris examples)**?



——————————————————————————————————————————————————



Okay, let's continue with **Part 3.3: Workflow Step 5 & 6 - Quality Assurance, Final PRD, and Delivery Planning**, using our Tetris game example to illustrate.



---



**The AI-Facilitated Iterative Development (AID) Workflow: A Comprehensive Guide**



**Part 3.3: Workflow Step 5 & 6 - QA, Final PRD, & Delivery**



With the AI Builder iteratively implementing sub-tasks, and the Master Task List reflecting progress, we now focus on broader quality assurance and preparing for "delivery" of the MVP.



**Step 5: Quality Assurance & Testing Framework Implementation**



This step runs concurrently with and culminates after AI Implementation (Step 4).



*   **5.1. Unit Testing (Driven by AI, Reviewed by Humans):**

*   **Context:** As specified in the `Implement_Specific_Subtask_Prompt` and the "Relevant Files" section of the `Master_Task_List.md`, the AI Builder is responsible for creating unit test files (e.g., `board.test.js`, `tetromino.test.js`) alongside the source code files.

*   **AI Builder Action:** For sub-tasks involving logic (e.g., Subtask 2.3: "Implement function to check if a cell is occupied or out of bounds in `src/board.js`"), the AI Builder also generates corresponding unit tests covering various cases (valid, invalid, edge conditions).

*   **Facilitator/QA Role:**

*   Reviews the AI-generated unit tests for coverage and correctness.

*   Ensures unit tests are run (e.g., via `npx jest tests/board.test.js`) as part of the review process for relevant sub-tasks.

*   If tests fail or coverage is inadequate, a revision is requested for that sub-task, specifically asking the AI to fix the code or improve the tests.

*   **Tetris Example:** For sub-task 2.3, the AI Builder creates `board.test.js` with tests like:

```javascript

// tests/board.test.js (conceptual snippet)

describe('Board Logic', () => {

it('should correctly identify occupied cells', () => { /* ... */ });

it('should identify out-of-bounds cells', () => { /* ... */ });

});

```

The Facilitator ensures these tests pass before approving sub-task 2.3.



*   **5.2. Integration Testing Checkpoints (Human-Led, AI can assist in setup):**

*   **Context:** As major Task Areas in the `Master_Task_List.md` are completed (e.g., "2.0 Implement Game Board Logic" and "3.0 Implement Tetromino Definition, Generation, and Movement"), the PRD's "Integration & Testing Strategy" (Section 7.3) will specify integration testing.

*   **Facilitator Action:**

*   Identifies that an integration checkpoint has been reached.

*   May prompt the AI Builder for assistance: `"Tasks 2.0 and 3.0 are now 'Done'. Based on the PRD, what are the key integration points between game board logic and Tetromino movement that need testing? Suggest 3-5 test scenarios."`

*   **QA/Facilitator Role:** Manually performs integration tests (e.g., "Can a Tetromino successfully land on the board? Does collision detection with existing blocks work?").

*   **Issue Handling:** Any issues found are logged as new sub-tasks (or revisions to existing ones) in the `Master_Task_List.md` and assigned to the AI Builder.

*   **Tetris Example:** After Task 3.0 is complete, the Facilitator tests if a newly generated Tetromino can be moved left/right and if it stops correctly at the bottom of an empty board or on top of other (simulated) blocks.



*   **5.3. User Experience (UX) Testing (Human-Led, Continuous):**

*   **Context:** Throughout the development process, especially as UI elements are implemented (Task Areas 1.0, 7.0).

*   **Facilitator/Product Owner Role:**

*   Continuously interacts with the developing application from a user's perspective.

*   Assesses intuitiveness, visual clarity, responsiveness of controls, and overall engagement.

*   Focuses on the core user workflows defined in PRD Section 2.

*   **Feedback Loop:** UX issues are translated into actionable sub-tasks for the AI Builder (e.g., "Subtask 7.1.X: Improve visibility of 'Next Piece' display by increasing font size and adding a border").

*   **Tetris Example:** The Product Owner plays the game at various stages, noting if controls feel laggy, if the score is easy to read, or if the game over state is clear.



*   **5.4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) (Product Owner & Stakeholders):**

*   **Context:** Occurs once all (or most critical) tasks in the `Master_Task_List.md` are marked `[x]` and major integration bugs are resolved.

*   **Product Owner Role:** Performs comprehensive testing against the full set of requirements and user stories in the `Tetris_MVP_PRD_v1.0.md`, specifically verifying the "Definition of Done" (PRD Section 1.6).

*   **Stakeholder Involvement (Optional):** Other stakeholders might be invited to play the game and provide feedback.

*   **Final Bug Bash:** Any remaining issues are logged and prioritized for fixing by the AI Builder before final approval.

*   **Tetris Example:** The Product Owner plays multiple full games of Tetris, trying to achieve all specified line clears, trigger game over, and verify scoring accuracy against the PRD.



**Step 6: Final PRD & Delivery Planning**



*   **6.1. Final PRD Update (Design Facilitator):**

*   **Action:** Once UAT is complete and all critical issues are resolved:

*   Update the `Tetris_MVP_PRD_v1.0.md` to its final version (e.g., `Tetris_MVP_PRD_v1.0_FINAL.md`).

*   Ensure the "Change Log" (PRD Section 10) is complete, noting any significant deviations or clarifications made during development.

*   Verify all sections reflect the as-built MVP.

*   **Facilitator's Role:** Manages this final documentation pass.



*   **6.2. Master Task List Finalization (Design Facilitator & AI Builder):**

*   **Action:** Ensure all tasks in `Tetris_Tasks_v1.0.md` are correctly marked `[x]`. The AI confirms the file reflects all approved changes.

*   Archive this task list as the record of work for the MVP.



*   **6.3. "Definition of Done" Verification (Product Owner & Facilitator):**

*   **Action:** Formally review the "Definition of Done" criteria from PRD Section 1.6 against the completed MVP.

*   **Product Owner Role:** Provides final sign-off that the MVP meets all agreed-upon requirements.



*   **6.4. Delivery/Deployment Planning (Facilitator, PO, Technical Stakeholders):**

*   **Action:** For a simple web app like Tetris MVP, "delivery" might mean:

*   AI Builder performs final code linting, minification, and bundling of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

*   These static files are prepared for deployment to a web server or static hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify).

*   Basic deployment instructions are documented (this could be another task for the AI Builder: "Generate deployment instructions for the Tetris MVP static files").

*   **For more complex Learnstar components:** This step would involve containerization, CI/CD pipeline configurations, etc., all detailed as tasks for the AI Builder.

*   **Tetris Example:** AI Builder bundles `index.html`, `style.css`, and all `.js` files into a `dist/` folder. Facilitator receives instructions: "Upload contents of `dist/` folder to your web host."



*   **6.5. Project Retrospective & Workflow Refinement (Product Owner & Facilitator):**

*   **Action:** Review the entire AID Workflow process for this project.

*   Identify what worked well with the AI Builder.

*   Note any challenges in prompting, clarification, or AI output.

*   Refine the Core System Prompt, prompt templates, or workflow steps for future projects.

*   Update the "Future Considerations" list with ideas for Tetris v1.1 or for improving the AID process itself.



---



This completes Part 3.3, and with it, a comprehensive walkthrough of the entire 6-Step AID Workflow, illustrated with the Tetris game example. We've covered project initiation, PRD creation, AI-assisted task generation, iterative AI implementation with human verification, robust quality assurance, and final delivery planning.



We now have:

1.  The documented **AI-Facilitated Iterative Development (AID) Workflow** itself (in 3 parts).

2.  The **`AID_PRD_Template.md`** artifact.



This should provide a very solid foundation for anyone looking to replicate or adapt this methodology.
