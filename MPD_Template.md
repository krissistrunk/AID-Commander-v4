## 1. Program Overview & Strategic Vision

### 1.1 Purpose of this Document

This Master Program Document (MPD) coordinates multiple Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for a complex software system that requires component-based development. It serves as the master orchestration document for the AI Builder and human stakeholders throughout the multi-component development lifecycle.

### 1.2 Program Overview

[Provide a comprehensive overview of the entire program. What is the complete system? What core business problem does it solve? How do the components work together to create value?]

### 1.3 Program Goals & Objectives

[List 3-5 clear, strategic goals for the entire program that span multiple components.]

1. Strategic Goal 1: [e.g., Create a unified learning platform that adapts to individual user needs]
2. Strategic Goal 2: [e.g., Enable seamless data flow between user interface, analytics, and content management]
3. Strategic Goal 3: [e.g., Establish scalable architecture for future feature expansion]

### 1.4 Critical Program Success Metrics

[Define the overarching metrics that determine program success across all components.]

* Primary Metric: [e.g., End-to-end user journey completion rate across all components]
* Secondary Metric: [e.g., System performance under full load with all components active]

### 1.5 Target Users & Stakeholders

[Describe users who interact with multiple components and stakeholders across the program.]

* Primary User Persona: [e.g., Advanced Course Creator who uses multiple tools]
* Secondary User Persona: [e.g., System Administrator managing the platform]
* Key Stakeholders: [e.g., Engineering, Product, Business Units]

### 1.6 Program Definition of Done

[Clearly state criteria for the entire program to be considered complete.]

1. All component PRDs are implemented and individually pass acceptance criteria
2. Cross-component integration tests pass successfully
3. End-to-end user workflows function across component boundaries
4. System performance meets non-functional requirements under full load
5. All components are deployed and operational in target environment

## 2. Component Architecture & Relationships

| Component ID | Component Name | Primary Responsibility | PRD Reference |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| COMP-001 | [Component Name] | [Brief description] | `[Component_PRD_File.md]` |
| COMP-002 | [Component Name] | [Brief description] | `[Component_PRD_File.md]` |
| COMP-003 | [Component Name] | [Brief description] | `[Component_PRD_File.md]` |

### 2.2 Component Dependency Map

[Visual or textual representation of how components depend on each other.]

```
Component Dependencies:

COMP-002 ‚Üí COMP-003 (sends events to)
COMP-003 ‚Üí COMP-001 (provides services to)
```

### 2.3 Shared System Architecture

[Describe architecture elements shared across components.]

* **Deployment Model:** [e.g., Microservices, Micro-frontends, Monolith with modules]
* **Technology Stack:** [e.g., Common frameworks, databases, APIs]
* **Communication Patterns:** [e.g., REST APIs, Event bus, Message queues]
* **Data Architecture:** [e.g., Shared databases, data synchronization strategies]

### 2.4 AI-Assisted Framework Harmonization

**ü§ñ Multi-Component Framework Advisory Enabled**

When defining your program architecture, the AI Builder will provide cross-component framework analysis to ensure optimal integration and minimal complexity.

#### Framework Compatibility Analysis
The AI will evaluate framework choices across all components for:

1. **Cross-Component Compatibility**
   - API compatibility between different framework choices
   - Data serialization/deserialization consistency
   - Authentication and session management alignment
   - Error handling and logging standardization

2. **Operational Efficiency**
   - Deployment pipeline compatibility
   - Monitoring and observability tool alignment
   - Development environment consistency
   - Build and testing tool harmonization

3. **Team Productivity**
   - Shared library and utility reuse opportunities
   - Common patterns and conventions across components
   - Knowledge transfer and skill overlap optimization
   - Documentation and maintenance standardization

#### AI Framework Harmonization Protocol
```
ü§ñ Multi-Component Framework Analysis

üìä Component Framework Matrix:
- COMP-001 (Frontend): React + TypeScript
- COMP-002 (Backend): Node.js + Express
- COMP-003 (Analytics): Python + FastAPI

üß† Compatibility Assessment:
- Technical: All components support JSON APIs, TypeScript types can be shared
- Integration: React can consume both Express and FastAPI endpoints seamlessly
- Operations: All frameworks support Docker containerization and standard monitoring
- Development: Team can leverage shared TypeScript types across frontend/backend

üîÑ Optimization Recommendations:
- Shared Package: Create shared TypeScript type definitions package
- API Standard: Implement OpenAPI specification for consistent API documentation
- Testing: Use common testing patterns (Jest for JS components, pytest for Python)

üìã Integration Simplifications:
- Reduces integration testing complexity by 40%
- Enables shared authentication middleware approach
- Allows unified error handling and logging format

‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Conflicts Identified:
- COMP-003 Python component requires additional CORS configuration
- Different deployment strategies may require container orchestration planning

Does this framework harmony approach align with your program goals?
```

#### Framework Selection Criteria for Multi-Component Programs
- **Consistency Over Optimization**: Prefer consistent patterns across components unless performance critical
- **Integration Simplicity**: Choose frameworks that integrate well with minimal custom bridging
- **Operational Alignment**: Ensure frameworks support unified deployment, monitoring, and maintenance
- **Team Capability**: Balance framework diversity with team expertise and learning curve
