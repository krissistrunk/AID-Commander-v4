# AID Commander

> A terminal-based tool that implements the AI-Facilitated Iterative Development (AID) Workflow to transform your software development process with AI as your implementation partner.

## What is AID Commander?

**AID Commander** is a command-line interface tool that automates the **AI-Facilitated Iterative Development (AID) Workflow**. Instead of manually managing AI interactions and task tracking, AID Commander provides a structured terminal environment that:

- **Orchestrates AI interactions** following the proven AID methodology
- **Manages task dependencies** and progress tracking automatically  
- **Enforces quality gates** with human approval checkpoints
- **Coordinates multi-component development** for complex projects
- **Maintains documentation** and audit trails throughout development

Think of AID Commander as your project management assistant that ensures the AI Builder follows best practices while keeping you in strategic control.

## What is the AID Workflow?

The underlying **AI-Facilitated Iterative Development (AID) Workflow** is a systematic methodology that positions an advanced AI Builder as your primary code implementer, while you (the human) provide strategic direction, detailed requirements, and quality oversight. AID Commander implements this workflow through an intuitive terminal interface.

## What You Get at the End

By following this workflow, you will receive:

### 📋 **Complete Documentation Package**
- **Comprehensive PRD** - Detailed product requirements document
- **Complete Task History** - Every task documented and tracked
- **Architecture Documentation** - Technical decisions and rationale
- **Test Coverage** - Unit tests and integration test results

### 💻 **Production-Ready Software**
- **Fully Functional MVP** - Meeting all specified requirements
- **Clean, Tested Code** - AI-generated but human-verified
- **Deployment-Ready Package** - Optimized and bundled for production
- **User Documentation** - Basic guides for end users

### 🎯 **Quality Assurance**
- **Human-Verified Features** - Every component reviewed and approved
- **Dependency Management** - Proper build order and integration
- **Performance Standards** - Meets specified non-functional requirements
- **User Acceptance** - Validated against real user needs

## Project Complexity Assessment

**🤔 Not sure which approach to use?** The AID Workflow supports both simple and complex projects:

### 📊 **Quick Assessment: Is Your Project Complex?**

Answer these questions to determine the right approach:

1. **Will your project have more than 5-7 major features or components?**
2. **Do you need multiple developers or teams working simultaneously?**
3. **Are there distinct modules that could be developed independently?**
4. **Will different parts use different technologies or databases?**
5. **Do you have complex integration requirements with multiple external systems?**

### 🎯 **Recommendation with Reasoning**

**📈 If you answered "Yes" to 3+ questions:** Use the **Multi-Component Approach**

**Why this recommendation:**
- **Technical considerations:** Multiple components allow for better separation of concerns, independent scaling, and technology diversity
- **Development efficiency:** Teams can work in parallel on different components without blocking each other
- **Risk mitigation:** Component isolation reduces the risk of one area affecting others during development
- **Future flexibility:** Modular architecture makes it easier to update, replace, or scale individual components
- **Quality assurance:** Smaller, focused components are easier to test and debug than monolithic systems

**📉 If you answered "Yes" to 0-2 questions:** Use the **Single PRD Approach**

**Why this recommendation:**
- **Technical considerations:** Single codebase reduces complexity, deployment overhead, and integration challenges
- **Development efficiency:** Simpler coordination, faster initial development, and easier debugging
- **Risk mitigation:** Fewer moving parts means fewer potential failure points and easier troubleshooting
- **Cost effectiveness:** Lower infrastructure and maintenance costs for smaller projects
- **Time to market:** Faster development cycle and simpler deployment process

## How You Interact with the Process

### 🎭 **Your Role (Human)**
You are the **Product Owner** and/or **Design Facilitator**. Your responsibilities:

- **Strategic Vision** - Define what you want built and why
- **Requirements Clarification** - Answer AI questions about features and functionality  
- **Quality Control** - Review and approve all AI-generated code
- **Priority Setting** - Decide what gets built first
- **Final Approval** - Sign off on completed features

### 🤖 **AI Builder Role**
The AI Builder is your **implementation partner**. It handles:

- **Code Generation** - Writes all source code based on your specifications
- **Task Breakdown** - Converts requirements into detailed implementation tasks
- **Technical Implementation** - Handles the "how" while you focus on the "what"
- **Testing** - Creates unit tests alongside code
- **Documentation** - Generates technical documentation

### 🔄 **The Interaction Pattern**

```
You Define → AI Suggests → You Approve → AI Implements → You Review → Repeat
```

**Example Interaction with AID Commander:**
1. **You:** Run `aid-commander task add "user authentication"`
2. **AID Commander:** Presents authentication options with AI recommendations
3. **You:** Select JWT authentication from the provided options
4. **AID Commander:** AI implements JWT system, shows progress in terminal
5. **You:** Review code through `aid-commander review`, approve or request changes
6. **AID Commander:** Marks task complete, automatically moves to next dependency

**Example Manual Interaction:**
1. **You:** "I need user authentication for my web app"
2. **AI:** "I need clarification on authentication method. My suggestion: JWT tokens for stateless authentication - easier to scale and secure. Does this work, or would you prefer session-based authentication?"
3. **You:** "JWT sounds good, proceed"
4. **AI:** *Implements JWT authentication system*
5. **You:** *Reviews code, tests functionality, approves*
6. **AI:** *Marks task complete, moves to next task*

4. **System performance testing** - Ensure the complete system meets performance requirements
5. **Deployment coordination** - AI prepares deployment for all components in correct order
6. **Complete documentation** - Component docs, integration docs, and system overview

## What Makes This Different?

### 🎯 **AI Suggest Mode**
Instead of waiting for you to answer every question, the AI provides intelligent suggestions:
- **Faster decisions** - AI suggests best practices, you approve or modify
- **Expert guidance** - Benefit from AI's knowledge of industry standards
- **Reduced back-and-forth** - Get moving quickly while maintaining control

### 🔒 **95% Confidence Protocol**
AI must be 95% confident before implementing anything:
- **No guessing** - AI asks for clarification when unsure
- **Quality assurance** - Prevents misunderstood requirements
- **Human oversight** - You stay in control of all decisions

### 📊 **Transparent Progress Tracking**
Every task has clear status and dependencies:
- **Real-time visibility** - Always know what's being worked on
- **Dependency management** - Tasks completed in proper order
- **Audit trail** - Complete history of all work done

## Support & Troubleshooting

### 🤔 **Common Questions**

**Q: What if the AI makes mistakes?**
A: That's why every task requires human review and approval. Mistakes are caught before they accumulate.

**Q: How technical do I need to be?**
A: You need to understand your business requirements. The AI handles the technical implementation details.

**Q: What if I want to change requirements mid-project?**
A: The PRD and task list are living documents. Updates are tracked in the change log.

**Q: How do I know if a task is actually complete?**
A: Each task has specific acceptance criteria. You test against these before approval.

### 🆘 **When Things Go Wrong**

- **AI is confused:** Use the 95% Confidence Protocol - AI will ask clarifying questions
- **Task dependencies unclear:** Review the Master Task List and update dependencies
- **Quality issues:** Use the revision request status `[R]` to send tasks back for fixes
- **Scope creep:** Update the PRD and add new tasks to the "Future Considerations" list
