**Perfect for:** First-time users, developers new to AI-assisted development, or anyone wanting to try the memory-enhanced workflow.

## 📋 What You'll Learn
- How to install and set up AID Commander v4.0
- Create your first memory-enhanced project
- Use basic memory and validation features
- Experience the 95% success framework

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Installation and Setup

### Install AID Commander v4.0
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/krissistrunk/AID-Commander-v4.git
cd AID-Commander-v4

# Install with basic dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Initialize AID Commander
aid-commander init

# Copy environment template
cp .env.template .env

# Edit the .env file (optional for beginners)
# You can use AID Commander without AI providers initially
```

**✅ Checkpoint:** You should see "AID Commander v4.0 initialized" message.

---

## 🎯 Step 2: Create Your First Memory-Enhanced Project

Let's create a simple "Todo App" project:

```bash
# Start a new project with memory
aid-commander start "TodoApp" --approach single_prd --memory

# Check what was created
aid-commander status
```

**What happened:**
- 🧠 Memory bank initialized for your project
- 📁 Project structure created
- 📝 Initial decision stored in memory
- 🎯 Ready for memory-enhanced development

**✅ Checkpoint:** You should see project status showing memory bank initialized.

---

## 🧠 Step 3: Experience Memory Intelligence

### Store Your First Decision
```bash
# Store a technology decision
aid-commander store-decision \
  "Frontend Technology Choice" \
  "Need to choose frontend framework for Todo App" \
  "React" \
  "Team is familiar with React and it has good ecosystem"
```

### Query Your Project Memory
```bash
# Ask memory about your project
aid-commander memory-query "frontend technology"

# Analyze with memory intelligence
aid-commander analyze "user interface design"
```

**What you'll see:**
- 🔍 Memory retrieves your previous decisions
- 💡 Context-aware suggestions based on your choices
- 📊 Relevance scoring for different options

**✅ Checkpoint:** Memory query should return your React decision.

## 📋 Step 4: Create a Simple PRD with Validation

### Create Your PRD File
Create `TodoApp_PRD.md` in your project directory:

```markdown
# Todo App - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction & Product Vision
A simple, user-friendly todo application for personal task management.

## User Workflows & Experience
- Users can add new tasks
- Users can mark tasks as complete
- Users can delete tasks
- Users can view all tasks in a list

## System Architecture & Technical Foundation
- Frontend: React (decided in memory)
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: SQLite for simplicity
- Deployment: Local development initially

## Functional Requirements & Implementation Tasks
1. Create task input form
2. Display task list
3. Toggle task completion
4. Delete task functionality
5. Data persistence

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Simple, clean interface
- Fast response times
- Works in modern browsers

## Testing Strategy
- Manual testing for basic functionality
- User feedback for improvements
```

### Validate Your PRD
```bash
# Run quality validation on your PRD
aid-commander validate prd

# Check overall project quality
aid-commander validate all
```

**What you'll see:**
- 📊 Quality score for your PRD
- ✅ What's working well
- 💡 Suggestions for improvement
- 🎯 Success probability calculation

**✅ Checkpoint:** Your PRD should pass basic validation with suggestions.

---

## 💬 Step 5: Chat with Memory-Enhanced AI

```bash
# Ask for development guidance
aid-commander chat "What should I implement first for my Todo App?"

# Get memory-informed recommendations
aid-commander chat "How should I structure my React components?"
```

**What's special:**
- 🧠 AI knows about your React decision from memory
- 📝 Responses reference your PRD content
- 🎯 Suggestions are tailored to your specific project
- 📊 Recommendations include quality considerations

**✅ Checkpoint:** AI responses should mention React and reference your stored decisions.

---

## 📈 Step 6: Track Your Progress

### Check Project Status
```bash
# Get comprehensive project overview
aid-commander status

# See what's in memory
aid-commander memory-query "project overview"
```

### Store Implementation Decisions
```bash
# As you make development choices, store them
aid-commander store-decision \
  "Component Structure" \
  "How to organize React components" \
  "Separate components for TaskList and TaskItem" \
  "Better separation of concerns and reusability"
```

---

## 🎉 Step 7: Experience the Memory Advantage

### Create a Second Project
```bash
# Start another project
aid-commander start "BlogApp" --memory

# Query memory from your first project
aid-commander analyze "React component design"
```

**The Magic:**
- 🧠 Memory remembers your React expertise
- 📊 Suggestions improve based on past projects
- 🎯 Quality validation uses your success patterns
- 💡 You build faster with each project
