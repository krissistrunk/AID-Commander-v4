## üèóÔ∏è Step 2: Multi-Component E-commerce Project

Let's build a complex e-commerce system with multiple components:

```bash
# Create sophisticated multi-component project
aid-commander start "EcommerceAPI" --approach multi_component --memory

# Navigate to project directory
cd EcommerceAPI
```

### Define Project Architecture Decisions
```bash
# Store major architectural decisions
aid-commander store-decision \
  "Microservices Architecture" \
  "Building scalable e-commerce platform with multiple services" \
  "Microservices with API Gateway" \
  "Better scalability, independent deployment, team autonomy"

aid-commander store-decision \
  "Database Strategy" \
  "Need databases for user data, products, orders, and analytics" \
  "PostgreSQL for transactional data, Redis for caching, Elasticsearch for search" \
  "PostgreSQL for ACID compliance, Redis for performance, Elasticsearch for complex search"

aid-commander store-decision \
  "Authentication Strategy" \
  "Secure authentication across multiple services" \
  "JWT with refresh tokens and OAuth2 integration" \
  "Stateless, secure, supports social login, scalable across services"
```

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** Memory should contain three major architectural decisions.

## üìù Step 3: Advanced PRD with Memory Intelligence

### Create Comprehensive PRD
Create `EcommerceAPI_PRD.md`:

```markdown

# Get memory-enhanced analysis
aid-commander analyze "microservices e-commerce architecture"
```

**What you'll see:**
- üß† Memory references your architectural decisions
- üìä Quality score with specific microservices feedback
- üí° Suggestions based on e-commerce patterns
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk analysis for complex architecture

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** PRD validation should reference your stored architectural decisions.

---

## üéØ Step 4: Advanced Memory Pattern Recognition

### Generate Memory-Informed Tasks
```bash
# Use memory to suggest implementation tasks
aid-context suggest-tasks . "microservices e-commerce backend"

# Analyze task complexity with memory
aid-commander analyze "user authentication service implementation"
```

### Query Advanced Memory Patterns
```bash
# Find patterns for your architecture
aid-commander memory-query "microservices authentication patterns"

# Get risk predictions
aid-commander memory-query "e-commerce scalability challenges"
```

### Store Implementation Patterns
```bash
# As you implement, store successful patterns
aid-commander store-decision \
  "Service Communication Pattern" \
  "How services should communicate with each other" \
  "Async messaging for non-critical, synchronous for critical operations" \
  "Balances performance with consistency requirements"

aid-commander store-decision \
  "Error Handling Strategy" \
  "Consistent error handling across all microservices" \
  "Centralized error handling with structured logging and circuit breakers" \
  "Improves debugging, prevents cascade failures, better monitoring"
```

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** Memory should show patterns emerging for microservices architecture.

---

## üîß Step 5: Quality Gates Integration

### Set Up Automated Quality Gates
```bash
# Configure strict quality gates
export QUALITY_GATES_ENABLED=true
export QUALITY_GATES_STRICT_MODE=true
export QUALITY_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD=95
```

### Validate Project Components
```bash
# Validate all components
aid-commander validate all

# Check success probability
aid-quality assess-project .

# Validate specific aspects
aid-commander validate prd
aid-commander validate tasks
aid-commander validate architecture
```

### Create Quality Validation Script
Create `validate_project.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "üîç Running Quality Gates Validation..."

# PRD Validation
echo "üìã Validating PRD..."
aid-commander validate prd
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå PRD validation failed"
    exit 1
fi

# Architecture Validation
echo "üèóÔ∏è Validating Architecture..."
aid-commander analyze "microservices architecture compliance"

# Success Probability Check
echo "üìä Calculating Success Probability..."
PROBABILITY=$(aid-commander validate all | grep "Success Probability" | awk '{print $3}')
echo "Success Probability: $PROBABILITY"

if [[ "$PROBABILITY" < "95%" ]]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Success probability below threshold"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ All quality gates passed!"
```

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** Quality gates should provide detailed feedback with 90%+ scores.

---

## üí¨ Step 6: Advanced AI Conversations

### Complex Technical Discussions
```bash
# Advanced architectural guidance
aid-commander chat "How should I implement the recommendation service to scale with user growth?"

# Memory-informed technical decisions
aid-commander chat "What's the best approach for handling distributed transactions across my microservices?"

# Performance optimization guidance
aid-commander chat "How can I optimize my e-commerce API for Black Friday traffic?"
```

### Context-Aware Problem Solving
```bash
# Get specific implementation guidance
aid-conversation process-request . "I'm seeing authentication issues between services. How should I debug this based on my architecture decisions?"

# Memory-enhanced troubleshooting
aid-commander chat "My search service is slow. Given my Elasticsearch decision, what optimizations should I implement?"
```

**What's advanced:**
- üß† AI references your specific architectural decisions
- üìä Suggestions consider your quality thresholds
- üîÑ Recommendations build on previous conversations
- üéØ Solutions tailored to your microservices setup

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** AI should reference your specific microservices decisions and provide targeted advice.

---

## üìà Step 7: Performance Monitoring and Optimization

### Monitor Memory Bank Performance
```bash
# Check memory operation performance
aid-commander status

# Analyze memory usage patterns
aid-memory query . "performance optimization patterns"

# View memory bank statistics
ls -la memory_bank/
```

### Optimize for Team Collaboration
```bash
# Export memory patterns for team sharing
aid-memory export . --format json > team_patterns.json

# Create team standards based on memory
aid-commander analyze "team development standards microservices"
```

### Advanced Memory Operations
```bash
# Bulk decision import
aid-commander store-decision \
  "API Versioning Strategy" \
  "How to version APIs across services" \
  "Semantic versioning with backward compatibility" \
  "Maintains stability while allowing evolution"

# Pattern analysis
aid-context analyze . "distributed system reliability patterns"
```

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** Performance monitoring should show optimized memory operations.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Step 8: CI/CD Integration

### Create GitHub Actions Workflow
Create `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml`:
```yaml
name: AID Commander Quality Gates

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality-validation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    
    - name: Install AID Commander
      run: |
        pip install -e ".[all]"
    
    - name: Initialize Memory Bank
      run: |
        aid-commander init
    
    - name: Validate Project Quality
      run: |
        aid-commander validate all
        
    - name: Check Success Probability
      run: |
        ./validate_project.sh
```

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** CI/CD should fail if quality gates don't pass.

---

## üéØ Step 9: Advanced Memory Analytics

### Analyze Success Patterns
```bash
# Find what's working well
aid-commander memory-query "successful microservices patterns"

# Identify potential improvements
aid-commander analyze "architecture optimization opportunities"

# Track decision outcomes
aid-commander memory-query "authentication implementation results"
```

### Cross-Project Learning
```bash
# Create second project to see memory transfer
aid-commander start "AnalyticsService" --memory

# Query lessons from e-commerce project
aid-commander analyze "microservices lessons learned"
```

**The Power:**
- üß† Memory improves recommendations across projects
- üìä Success patterns become reusable knowledge
- üéØ Each project builds on previous experiences
- üí° Team knowledge compounds over time

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** Second project should benefit from e-commerce lessons.
